1. Complex traits & QTL mapping 
  - look at Karl & Saunak's chapter 1 
  - goal is to motivate study of complex traits with QTL mapping

Identification of genes that affect measurable phenotypes has a long and successful history in model organisms. Complex traits include classical clinical phenotypes such as systolic blood pressure and body weight as well as newly measurable biomolecular phenotypes like gene expression levels, protein concentrations, and lipid levels. Understanding the genetic underpinnings of such traits may inform many areas of biology, medicine, and public health.

The first reported QTL study is from 1923, 30 years before the discovery of the structure of DNA \citep{watson1953molecular}. \citet{sax1923} examined seed weight for the common bean (\emph{}) in an F$_2$ intercross. He assigned each F$_2$ subject to a gene class by examining its seed color patterns. 

\citet{lander1989mapping} kickstarted modern QTL mapping methods research with their seminal report in the late 1980s. Their article 

Goals of a QTL study depend on its scientific context. Often a researcher seeks to identify genomewide positions of QTL for each trait of interest. In some studies, the total number of QTL for a trait may be more interesting than the QTL positions.

A QTL study begins with a scientific question and the choice of a study design. Elements to consider include the mating design, phenotyping plan, genotyping plan, and statistical analysis methods. For most of the 20th century, attaining clinical phenotypes, such as body weight, was less costly than genotyping. This setting sometimes led researchers to selectively genotype only those organisms with extreme phenotype values. With diminishing costs for both genotyping and phenotyping, many recent studies genotype and phenotype all subjects.



Since the 1980s, researchers have written and shared computer software for QTL studies. Early efforts included MAPMAKER, QTL Cartographer, ... Since the early 2000s, the "qtl" R package has been a state-of-the-art resource for QTL mapping studies. It is open-source, free to download, well documented, and well supported.

2. Univariate QTL scan in two-parent crosses
  - goal: explain a QTL "scan" in backcross & intercross. Use pictures/diagrams of chromosome(s)
  What are the genotypes of individuals from a backcross?
  What are the genotypes of individuals from an intercross (F2)?

3.5 Testing pleiotropy v separate QTL in two-parent crosses

- redo a citation search on Jiang & Zeng 1995
  
Jiang and Zeng first developed a test for pleiotropy vs. separate QTL in two-parent crosses. They developed it in the context of their work in multivariate QTL studies with composite interval mapping. They framed the scientific question of whether two traits are affected by a single, shared locus or by two distinct loci in terms of two statistical hypotheses. The null hypothesis states that there is a single pleiotropic locus that affects both traits, while the alternative hypothesis is that there are two distinct but nearby loci, with each locus affecting exactly one trait.





Knott and Haley subsequently reported methods for testing pleiotropy vs. separate QTL in two-parent crosses. Knott and Haley integrated their earlier work on univariate QTL mapping with marker regression with Jiang and Zeng's multivariate methods to develop a test of pleiotropy vs. separate QTL with multivariate marker regression methods.
