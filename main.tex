\end{itemize}

Identification of genes that affect measurable phenotypes has a long and
successful history in model organisms. Complex traits include classical
clinical phenotypes such as systolic blood pressure and body weight as
well as newly measurable biomolecular phenotypes like gene expression
levels, protein concentrations, and lipid levels. Understanding the
genetic underpinnings of such traits may inform many areas of biology,
medicine, and public health.

The first reported QTL study is from 1923, 30 years before the discovery
of the structure of DNA \citep{watson1953molecular}. \citet{sax1923association}
examined seed weight for the common bean (\emph{Phaseolus vulgaris}) in
an F\(_2\) intercross. He assigned each F\(_2\) subject to a gene class
by examining its seed color patterns.

\citet{lander1989mapping} kickstarted modern QTL mapping methods
research with their seminal report in the late 1980s. Their article

Goals of a QTL study depend on its scientific context. Often a
researcher seeks to identify genomewide positions of QTL for each trait
of interest. In some studies, the total number of QTL for a trait may be
more interesting than the QTL positions.

A QTL study begins with a scientific question and the choice of a study
design. Elements to consider include the mating design, phenotyping
plan, genotyping plan, and statistical analysis methods. For most of the
last century, attaining clinical phenotypes, such as body weight, was
much less costly than genotyping. This setting sometimes led researchers
to selectively genotype only those organisms with extreme phenotype
values. With diminishing costs for both genotyping and phenotyping, many
recent studies genotype and phenotype all subjects.

Since the 1980s, researchers have written and shared computer software
for QTL studies. Early efforts included MAPMAKER, QTL Cartographer,
\ldots{} Since the early 2000s, the ``qtl'' R package has been a
state-of-the-art resource for QTL mapping studies. It is open-source,
free to download, well documented, and well supported.

Jiang \& Zeng 1995 Knott \& Haley 2000

Jiang and Zeng developed multivariate methods for QTL mapping in
two-parent crosses. They devised a multivariate analog of Zeng's
composite interval mapping (Zeng 1993, 1994). This strategy treats
phenotypes as arising from a mixture of normal distributions in which
each genotype class has distinct distribution parameters. Within this
multivariate mapping framework, Jiang and Zeng developed the first test
of pleiotropy vs.~separate QTL.

Jiang and Zeng first developed a test for pleiotropy vs.~separate QTL in
two-parent crosses. They developed it in the context of their work in
multivariate QTL studies with composite interval mapping. They framed
the scientific question of whether two traits are affected by a single,
shared locus or by two distinct loci in terms of two statistical
hypotheses. The null hypothesis states that there is a single
pleiotropic locus that affects both traits, while the alternative
hypothesis is that there are two distinct but nearby loci, with each
locus affecting exactly one trait.

Knott and Haley subsequently reported methods for testing pleiotropy
vs.~separate QTL in two-parent crosses. Knott and Haley integrated their
earlier work on univariate QTL mapping with marker regression with Jiang
and Zeng's multivariate methods to develop a test of pleiotropy
vs.~separate QTL with multivariate marker regression methods.

Jiang and Zeng (1995)

One disadvantage of multivariate compositive interval mapping is the
computing requirements for the iterative expectation-maximization
procedures needed for parameter estimation. This prompted Knott and
Haley (2000) to develop a marker regression-based approximation to
multivariate composite interval mapping. Knott and Haley (2000) used a
multivariate linear model for simultaneous mapping of multiple traits.
They also presented a multivariate marker regression-based test of
pleiotropy vs.~separate QTL. This test is suitable for subjects that are
equally related to each other, like the collection of offspring in an
F\(_2\) intercross of two inbred lines.

\end{itemize}

While QTL mapping studies in the 1990s contributed to many advances in
genetics and biology, complex trait researchers recognized the mapping
resolution limitations in crosses involving two inbred lines. Seeking
greater precision for QTL positions, scientific communities collectively
decided to pool their expertise and resources into community-supported
and community-maintained model organism mapping populations. These new
mapping populations would incorporate genetic material from more than
two inbred founder lines. The accumulated meiotic recombination events
over many generations would enhance mapping resolution over previously
available subjects.

Products of these community-based efforts include the Collaborative
Cross and Diversity Outbred populations from mouse researchers and
Drosophila Synthetic Reference Panel and \ldots{} in the fruit fly
scientific community. In subsequent years, scientists created
multiparental populations in many other organisms, including \ldots{}
