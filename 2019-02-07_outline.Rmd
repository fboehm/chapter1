  - Backcross - Pedigree Figure needed
  - Intercross - Pedigree Figure needed

3.1 How to perform a QTL scan in a backcross? 

4. What are limitations of two-parent designs?
  - mapping resolution, genetic diversity



5. What are multiparental populations?

6. What is the Diversity Outbred mouse population?
  - see also Andrew's thesis

7. What is pleiotropy? 

8. Why do we care about pleiotropy? 

9. How can we assess pleiotropy in QTL studies? 
  multivariate QTL mapping in two-parent crosses
  multivariate QTL mapping in multiparental populations

10. Why is it useful to test for pleiotropy in QTL studies in MPP?
